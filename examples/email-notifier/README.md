# Organisely Email Notifier Bot

A simple bot that logs "yes" whenever you receive an email in Organisely.

## Features

- âœ… Listens for email received events
- âœ… Logs "yes" to console when email arrives
- âœ… Shows email details (sender, subject, timestamp)
- âœ… Easy to extend and customize

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the bot:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **For development:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## How it works

This bot uses the Organisely SDK to listen for `email.received` events. When an email arrives in your Organisely inbox, the bot will:

1. Receive the webhook from Organisely
2. Check if it's an email event
3. Log "yes" to the console
4. Display email details

## Configuration

To use this bot with Organisely:

1. Create a new V2 Bot integration in Organisely
2. Set the webhook URL to your bot's endpoint
3. Enable the `email.received` event trigger
4. Add the `read:emails` scope
